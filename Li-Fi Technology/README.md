## Li-Fi Technology

* ### INTRODUCTION - 
   * Li-Fi(Light-Fidelity) is a wireless optical networking technology that uses light emitting diode (LEDâ€™s) for data transmission. 
   * Li-Fi can transmit at multiple Gigabits, is more reliable, virtually interference free and uniquely more secular than radio technology such as Wi-Fi or cellular.
   * Its mode of network technology actually serves a dual purpose as it aims to provide overhead illumination to households as well as facilitate the transfer of data.
   * This technology can potentially form a basis for 5G/6G technologies.
   
* ### METHODOLOGY -
   * LiFi makes use of visible light through overhead lighting for the transmission of data. 
   * Data is transmitted by LED bulbs and received by photoreceptors i.e LDR, photoresistors etc. Sensitivity and perception of data transmission is much faster than the human eye  can follow.
   * A Li-Fi system essentially has two qualifying components: At least one device containing a photodiode in order to receive light signals and a light source equipped with a signal processing unit for the transmission of signals.
   * Operational procedure follows the simple logic that if the LED is off, then the device transmits a digital 0 and if the LED is on, the device transmits a logic HIGH (1). The LED can be switched off and on very quickly which gives many opportunities to transmit different forms of data. 
   * Once these signals from LED are received and demodulated, they can now be converted into a continuous stream of binary data that contain videos, images, audio, text, or applications that are readily-consumable on any internet-enabled device.
   
 * ### ADVANTAGES -
   * __DATA TRANSMISSION SPEEDS__ : Tests conducted by various companies and engineers have revealed LiFi to produce speeds of over 100 Gbps. Some tests even revealed that it can deliver data for up to 224 Gbps. These speeds are clearly miles ahead of those produced by WiFi, which currently sits at a maximum of 100 Mbps. This is due to the fact that the visible light spectrum is 1,000 times larger than the RF spectrum, which is only about 300 GHz.
