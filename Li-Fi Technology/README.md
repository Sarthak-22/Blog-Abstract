## Li-Fi Technology

* ### INTRODUCTION - 
   * Li-Fi(Light-Fidelity) is a wireless optical networking technology that uses light emitting diode (LEDâ€™s) for data transmission. 
   * Li-Fi can transmit at multiple Gigabits, is more reliable, virtually interference free and uniquely more secular than radio technology such as Wi-Fi or cellular.
   * Its mode of network technology actually serves a dual purpose as it aims to provide overhead illumination to households as well as facilitate the transfer of data.
   * This technology can potentially form a basis for 5G/6G technologies.
   
* ### METHODOLOGY -
   * LiFi makes use of visible light through overhead lighting for the transmission of data. 
   * Data is transmitted by LED bulbs and received by photoreceptors i.e LDR, photoresistors etc. Sensitivity and perception of data transmission is much faster than the human eye  can follow.
   * A Li-Fi system essentially has two qualifying components: At least one device containing a photodiode in order to receive light signals and a light source equipped with a signal processing unit for the transmission of signals.
   * Operational procedure follows the simple logic that if the LED is off, then the device transmits a digital 0 and if the LED is on, the device transmits a logic HIGH (1). The LED can be switched off and on very quickly which gives many opportunities to transmit different forms of data. 
   * Once these signals from LED are received and demodulated, they can now be converted into a continuous stream of binary data that contain videos, images, audio, text, or applications that are readily-consumable on any internet-enabled device.
   
 * ### ADVANTAGES -
   * __DATA TRANSMISSION SPEEDS__ : Tests conducted by various companies and engineers have revealed LiFi to produce speeds of over 100 Gbps. Some tests even revealed that it can deliver data for up to 224 Gbps. These speeds are clearly miles ahead of those produced by WiFi, which currently sits at a maximum of 100 Mbps. This is due to the fact that the visible light spectrum is 1,000 times larger than the RF spectrum, which is only about 300 GHz. 
   * __ENERGY EFFICIENCY__ : In WiFi, the transmission of data requires having two radios for the transmission of radio waves. These radios communicate with each other continuously through RF transmitters installed within the radio and a baseband chip, which takes up a lot of energy just to discern data signals from the noise from several other devices using the same radio frequency. In contrast, LiFi makes use of overhead LED lights as a medium for data transmission. Because it only requires a light source and a photodiode to decode the light signals, the entire process of data transmission and communication requires lower overall energy. Plus, LED lights are used as opposed to other forms of light bulbs, making it a more efficient source of light.
   * __SECURITY__ : The limited coverage of LiFi can also be seen as a good thing since it increases network security. Again, because LiFi signals cannot pass through walls, interference from outside forces is limited. This also makes it ideal for use in sensitive areas where remote piracy and hacking is prevalent. As such, it is suitable for use for areas involved in research and development, finance, defense, and even mass transport.
   * __DATA DENSITY__ : One of the biggest limitations of WiFi is its vulnerability in areas with high congestion. The transfer of data within areas with a high volume of users tend to be slower than areas with lower volumes of users. On the other hand, LiFi is not subject to the same limitations and, in fact, works well in very dense environments. Especially in areas where many light bulbs are present, LiFi can still produce high speeds as each VLC light source can deliver the same speed, even with multiple users.
   
 * __CONCLUSION__ - 
   * As we all know, WiFi has certainly helped improve the quality of life exponentially as it helped pave the way for faster communication and the improvement of even the most basic societal functions. It has, however, succumbed to many different factors that have also affected its performance. These factors include congestion, limitations of use due to interference with other functions, and bandwidth saturation, which clearly exposes the shortcomings of this existing technology.
   * The introduction of LiFi is certainly a welcome one. Of course, with limitations in basic infrastructure, the total replacement of WiFi in favor of LiFi is next to impossible. However, what it does present is a viable option that can be used as an alternative especially in areas that are sensitive to the prevailing technology.
